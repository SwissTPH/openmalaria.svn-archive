#summary seasonality in EIR in dynamic transmission models.

= Introduction =

The user should be aware that the dynamic transmission modelled (mode="4") is not forced after the warm-up period and often fluctuates to a greater or lesser extent (usually below the level input), particularly when close to the limit of sustainable transmission (e.g. with high case-management coverage). After the warm-up period, with dynamic transmission (mode="4"), the seasonality of the mosquito emergence rate (N_v0) is equal to the seasonality specified under the EIR element plus a delay (about 20 days in the 5 day time step model), and, as a result, the seasonality of the simulated EIR (which is close to that of S_v) may differ from the seasonality of the input EIR substantially. Even if the annualEIR is equal before and after the end of the warm-up period, the switch in seasonality may alter the annual number of new infections. Running scenarios without interventions shows the dynamics of EIR and human infectiousness (the continuous output mode with duringInit="true" is convenient for viewing this). With static transmission (mode="2") the phenomenon described above does not occur.
