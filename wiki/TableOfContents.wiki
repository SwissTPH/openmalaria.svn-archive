== Building Open Malaria ==
 * [UnixBuildOpenMalaria On Unix]
 * [WindowsBuildOpenMalaria On Windows]

Additionally, there's a [UnixBuildWindows summary] of how I tried (and failed) to cross-compile Windows binaries from linux, and some old documentation of how to [LinuxCompiling build openmalaria on linux].

*Note:* The unittests have a dependency on [http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/ yaml-cpp]. If you *disable OM_CXXTEST_ENABLE* (a CMake option), you won't need to install yaml-cpp.
