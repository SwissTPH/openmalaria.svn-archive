#summary Description of mosquito-stage malarial interventions

= Mosquito-stage interventions =

The following table lists interventions which have been implemented in OpenMalaria, and which deployment methods are available:

|| intervention || mass-deployment || continuous-deployment ||
|| [ModelIntervVector#Change_EIR changeEIR] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervVector#Insecticide_Treated_Nets ITN] || yes || yes ||
|| [ModelIntervVector#Indoor_Residual_Spraying IRS] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervVector#Vector_Availability VectorAvailability] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervVector#Larviciding larviciding] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervVector#Uninfect_Vectors uninfectVectors] || yes || no ||

Note: all but the changeEIR intervention depend on the vector transmission model.

== Change EIR ==

This intervention is used to replace transmission settings. It can be used, for example, to switch to EIR settings recorded during a trial. It can only be used with the non-vector transmission model.

The `changeEIR` element has the same type as the [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/wiki/XmlScenario#Non-vector_parameters:_nonVector nonVector] element.

{{{
    <changeEIR>
      <timed eipDuration="10" time="0">
        <EIRDaily origin="interpolate">0.00219</EIRDaily>
        <EIRDaily origin="interpolate">0.00210</EIRDaily>
        <EIRDaily origin="interpolate">0.00202</EIRDaily>
        ...
      </timed>
    </changeEIR>
}}}

The new EIR is always applied from the _beginning_ of the intervention period, _not_ the step of deployment. It must thus always contain enough daily entries for the entire intervention period.

== Net / indoor spraying interventions ==

The following interventions all work by multiplying [XmlEntoVector vector model] parameters affecting individual humans.

Description of all effects uses the generic [ModelDecayFunctions decay functions framework] — see [ModelDecayFunctions#Configuration configuration] (`DecayFunctionValue` elements).

=== Insecticide Treated Nets ===

NOTE: ITN model will be changed in the next release

ITNs affect the availability of hosts to mosquitoes, and the chance of a mosquito successfully biting and fleeing an ITN-protected human. These properties are described per mosquito species, in the `interventions` `descriptions` section. For example:

{{{
<anopheles mosquito="gambiae_ss">
  <ITNDescription name="LLIN test">
    <deterrency L="3" function="exponential" initial="0.44"/>
    <preprandialKillingEffect L="3" function="exponential" initial="0.27"/>
    <postprandialKillingEffect L="3" function="exponential" initial="0.27"/>
  </ITNDescription>
</anopheles>
}}}

Uses standard [ModelInterventions#Continuous_descriptions continuous] and [ModelInterventions#Timed_descriptions timed] deployment.

=== Indoor Residual Spraying ===

IRS affects the availability of hosts to mosquitoes, and the chance of a mosquito surviving resting (egg incubation) after having fed on an IRS-protected human. Its effects should be described in the intervention `descriptions` element, for example:

{{{
    <IRS name="DDT test">
      <decay L="0.5" function="exponential"/>
      <anophelesParams mosquito="gambiae_ss">
        <deterrency value="0.56"/>
        <killingEffect value="0.24"/>
      </anophelesParams>
      <anophelesParams mosquito="funestus">
        <deterrency value="0.56"/>
        <killingEffect value="0.24"/>
      </anophelesParams>
      <anophelesParams mosquito="arabiensis">
        <deterrency value="0.56"/>
        <killingEffect value="0.24"/>
      </anophelesParams>
      <timed coverage="0.95" time="7"/>
    </IRS>
}}}

Uses standard [ModelInterventions#Timed_descriptions timed deployment].

=== Vector Availability ===

A vector deterrent intervention functions similarly to ITN/IRS interventions, but affecting only the availability of humans to mosquitoes. Example:

{{{
    <vectorDeterrent name="hypothetical deterrency">
      <decay L="4" function="exponential"/>
      <anophelesParams mosquito="gambiae_ss">
        <deterrency value="0.2"/>
      </anophelesParams>
      <timed coverage="0.7" time="7"/>
    </vectorDeterrent>
}}}

Uses standard [ModelInterventions#Timed_descriptions timed deployment].

== Larviciding ==

NOTE: Old larviciding implementation was removed in schema 28. New implementation due to be added soonish, probably in version 30.

A larviciding intervention is currently also available, but very simple in that there is no feedback effect of reduction in the number of adult mosquitoes on the number of larvae, nor any concept of saturation. The implementation will likely be improved in the future.

Example timed-deployment description:
{{{
<intervention time="173">
  <larviciding>
    <anopheles duration="12" effectiveness="0.75" mosquito="gambiae_ss"/>
    <anopheles duration="12" effectiveness="0.75" mosquito="funestus"/>
    <anopheles duration="12" effectiveness="0.75" mosquito="arabiensis"/>
  </larviciding>
</intervention>
}}}

Here, the `duration` parameter specifies how long the larviciding is effective for. `effectiveness` gives the proportion of larvae killed by the larviciding. The `mosquito` parameter specifies which species is affected — this must be described for all species (it will have no effect on species not explicitly listed).

== Uninfect Vectors ==

A special intervention which instantly uninfects all mosquitoes of malarial parasites (though doesn't prevent reinfection). If combining with mass drug administration to eliminate malaria from a scenario, note that humans can harbour gametocytes up to 20 days following "parasite clearance", hence vectors will need to be uninfected multiple times.

Example, clearing vector infections multiple times in line with above note about eliminating malaria:
{{{
    <MDA>
      <timed coverage="1" time="73"/>
      <timed coverage="1" time="74"/>
      <timed coverage="1" time="75"/>
      <timed coverage="1" time="76"/>
      <timed coverage="1" time="77"/>
      <timed coverage="1" time="78"/>
    </MDA>
    <uninfectVectors>
      <timed time="73"/>
      <timed time="74"/>
      <timed time="75"/>
      <timed time="76"/>
      <timed time="77"/>
      <timed time="78"/>
    </uninfectVectors>
}}}
