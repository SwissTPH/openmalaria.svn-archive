Welcome to the !OpenMalaria wiki on google-code.

!OpenMalaria is an open source C++ program for simulating malaria epidemiology and interventions against malaria.  It is based on microsimulations of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in humans, originally developed for simulating malaria vaccines and described  
[http://www.ajtmh.org/content/75/2_suppl here]. These models simulate the dynamics of malaria parasitaemia in the course of an infection, of transmission, of immunity, and of the processes leading to illness and death. The system is set up to simulate malaria in village, or district size human populations. The original models have been extended to include simulation of the dynamics of malaria in the mosquito vector, and by including alternative model structures for many of the components of the human models. The models allow for variations between humans in their exposure to mosquitoes, and in their responses to the parasite, but do not consider  

!OpenMalaria can be used to simulate interventions against malaria (both interventions against the mosquito vector, and interventions that acting against malaria in humans (e.g. by chemotherapy, or vaccines).   

!OpenMalaria makes use of a is a general platform for comparing, fitting, and evaluating different malaria models, to ensure that the models reproduce patterns of infection and disease observed in the field in malaria endemic areas. 

= Applications =

The main applications of !OpenMalaria are:

== Simulation of current malariological situations ==

Simulations of _status quo_ malaria situations can be used for estimating parameters that have not been measured from field data.  For instance, the models can be used to predict mortality rates from entomological data. Such simulations are also useful for validating models.

An overview of how to set up and use !OpenMalaria to simulate malaria in a particular field site can be found [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/wiki/Instructions here]. 

== Prediction of epidemiological impacts of interventions ==

Prediction of epidemiological impacts of interventions has two main uses:
- analysis of novel interventions to inform the development of target product profiles
- analysis of the effects of different deployment strategies for existing interventions, to help in planning malaria control programs. 

There are several methods of carrying out predictive simulations:

 * as a [SetupOverview stand-alone program], capable of simulating a few hand-crafted scenarios and producing results analyzable with spread-sheets or simple scripts
 * via the [http://boinc.berkeley.edu/ BOINC] volunteer computing platform [http://www.malariacontrol.net/] and a semi-automated experiment design and analysis platform (under development), capable of handling entire experiments of 10000-100000 scenarios
 * via a GUI-driven job submission system (under development), capable of deploying simulations on different computer resources.

== Economic (cost-effectiveness) analyses ==

The outputs from predictive simulations can be linked to cost data from endemic countries to analyse the economics of malaria interventions.  

== Uncertainty analysis ==

The project also analyzes different components of uncertainty associated with sets of model predictions, considering stochastic uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, model uncertainty. 

= Development =
== [ModelsOverview Models] ==

Each simulation requires implementation of various components, from transmission to within-host parasite dynamics to drug action.

For an overview of the model-components represented, see [ModelsOverview here]. 

== [Code] ==

The openmalaria project now has a [https://www.ohloh.net/p/openmalaria considerable code base]. The core program is now entirely written in C++, having Fortran roots. TODO: an overview of the code.

Instructions for compiling the code can be found [BuildSystem here].
