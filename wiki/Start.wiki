Welcome to the *openmalaria* wiki on google-code.

*openmalaria* is an open source C++ program for simulating malaria epidemiology and the impacts on that epidemiology of interventions against malaria.  It is based on microsimulations of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in humans, originally developed for simulating malaria vaccines and described  
[http://www.ajtmh.org/content/75/2_suppl here]. These models simulate the dynamics of malaria parasitaemia in the course of an infection, of transmission, of immunity, and of the processes leading to illness and death. The system is set up to simulate malaria in village, or district size human populations. The original models have been extended to include simulation of the dynamics of malaria in the mosquito vector, and by including alternative model structures for many of the components of the human models. The models allow for variations among humans in their exposure to mosquitoes, and in their responses to the parasite.

*openmalaria* can be used to simulate interventions against the mosquito vector and interventions that act against malaria in humans (for example, chemotherapy, or vaccines).   

*openmalaria* is a general platform for comparing, fitting, and evaluating different malaria models, to ensure that the models reproduce patterns of infection and disease observed in the field in malaria-endemic areas. 

= Applications =

The main applications of *openmalaria* are:

== Simulation of current malarialogical situations ==

Simulations of _status quo_ malaria situations can be used to estimate parameters that have not been measured from field data.  For instance, models can be used to predict mortality rates from entomological data. Such simulations are also useful for validating models.

An overview of how to use *openmalaria* to simulate malaria in a particular field site can be found [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/wiki/Instructions here]. 

== Prediction of epidemiological impacts of interventions ==

Prediction of epidemiological impacts of interventions is used to 

 * analyze novel interventions to inform the development of target product profiles

 * analyze the effects of different deployment strategies for existing interventions

 * analysis the potential effects for new interventions or planned malaria control programs. 

There are several methods for carrying out predictive simulations:

 * as a [SetupOverview stand-alone program], capable of simulating a few hand-crafted scenarios and producing results analyzable with spread-sheets or simple scripts
 * via the [http://boinc.berkeley.edu/ BOINC] volunteer computing platform [http://www.malariacontrol.net/] and a semi-automated experiment design and analysis platform, capable of handling entire experiments of 10000-100000 scenarios
 * via a GUI-driven job submission system (under development), capable of deploying simulations on different computer resources.

== Economic (cost-effectiveness) analyses ==

The outputs from predictive simulations can be linked to cost data from endemic countries to analyze the economics of malaria interventions.  

== Uncertainty analysis ==

The value of a point estimate is greatly enhanced when the variability associated with that point estimate is also available. The project analyzes different components of uncertainty associated with sets of model predictions, considering stochastic uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and model uncertainty.

== [ModelsOverview Models] ==

Each simulation requires implementation of various components, from transmission to within-host parasite dynamics to drug action. These model components are described in more detail [ModelsOverview here].
