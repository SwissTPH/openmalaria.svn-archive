Welcome to the !OpenMalaria wiki on google-code.

!OpenMalaria is an open source C++ program for simulating malaria epidemiology and interventions against malaria.  It is based on microsimulations of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in humans, originally developed for simulating malaria vaccines and described  
[http://www.ajtmh.org/content/75/2_suppl here]. The models simulate the dynamics of malaria parasitaemia in the course of an infection, of transmission, of immunity, and of the processes leading to illness and death.  They also simulate interventions against malaria (both by controlling the mosquito vector, or by acting against malaria in humans (e.g. by chemotherapy, or vaccines).    

= Applications & Usage =

The applications of !OpenMalaria are:

==Optimizing models of malaria epidemiology and control==

!OpenMalaria makes use of a is a general platform for comparing, fitting, and evaluating different malaria models.  

==Prediction of the effects of different interventions and control programs==

There are several methods of carrying out predictive simulations:

 * as a [SetupOverview stand-alone program], capable of simulating a few hand-crafted scenarios and producing results analyzable with spread-sheets or simple scripts
 * via the [http://boinc.berkeley.edu/ BOINC] volunteer computing platform [http://www.malariacontrol.net/] and a semi-automated experiment design and analysis platform (under development), capable of handling entire experiments of 10000-100000 scenarios
 * via a GUI-driven job submission system (under development), capable of deploying simulations on different computer resources.

The outputs from these simulations can be linked to cost data from endemic countries to analyse the economics of malaria interventions.  

For first-time users, an overview of how to set up and use !OpenMalaria to simulate malaria in a particular field site can be found [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/wiki/Instructions here]. 

== Uncertainty analysis ==

The project also analyzes the uncertainty associated with sets of model predictions. 

= Development =
== [ModelsOverview Models] ==

Each simulation requires implementation of various components, from transmission to within-host parasite dynamics to drug action.

For an overview of the model-components represented, see [ModelsOverview here]. 

== [Code] ==

The openmalaria project now has a [https://www.ohloh.net/p/openmalaria considerable code base]. The core program is now entirely written in C++, having Fortran roots. TODO: an overview of the code.

Instructions for compiling the code can be found [BuildSystem here].
