Welcome to the OpenMalaria wiki on google-code. Here we have some information on the project's code and a little on the mathematical models used in the code.


== Applications & Usage ==

OpenMalaria is a general platform for comparing, fitting, and evaluating different malaria models, and for quantitative prediction of effects of different interventions and integrated control programs.   The models comprise individual-based stochastic simulations of malaria epidemiology, health systems, and malaria interventions.  The outputs from the core C++ program can be linked to cost data from endemic countries to analyse the economics of malaria interventions.

There are two envisaged methods of using the simulator:

 * [SetupOverview as a stand-alone program], capable of simulating a few hand-crafted scenarios and producing results analysable with spread-sheets or simple scripts
 * via the [http://www.malariacontrol.net/ BOINC volunteer computing platform] and a semi-automated experiment design and analysis platform (under development), capable of handling entire experiments of 10000-100000 scenarios


== Development ==
=== Models ===

The model as a whole consists of many components, from transmission to within-host parasite dynamics to drug action.

For an overview of the model-components represented, see (TODO). For a list of papers describing some part of the model, see (TODO).

=== Code ===

The openmalaria project now has a [https://www.ohloh.net/p/openmalaria considerable code base]. The core program is now entirely written in C++, having Fortran roots. TODO: an overview of the code.

Instructions for compiling the code can be found [BuildSystem here].


== Team ==

OpenMalaria is being developed by a team from the [http://www.swisstph.ch/research/public-health-and-epidemiology/biostatistics/modelling-of-malaria.html Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)], the [http://ndssl.vbi.vt.edu/index.php Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory at Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]
