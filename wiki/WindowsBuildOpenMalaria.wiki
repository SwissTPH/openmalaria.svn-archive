#summary How to set up and build openmalaria on windows

= Set up =

Create a working directory. Checkout openmalaria into a sub-folder (see the [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/source/checkout Source] tab). Perhaps use TortoiseSvn for this...

= Dependencies =

Openmalaria requires the following; for many just run the installer:
 * gsl - get from [ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/gnu/gsl here] (oldest supported is 1.11); extract to your working directory above the openmalaria code and rename to "gsl". Hopefully something like this works.
  * You then need to compile the libraries or get them from somewhere... TODO
 * XSD - run the .msi installer from [http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml here]. If you already have an old version, delete scenario.cxx, scenario.hxx and scenario.ixx.
 * Xerces-C - versions 2.8 or 3.0 should work; 3.0 is included with the XSD installer for windows
 * zlib - get the DLL download from [www.zlib.net here], extract to the working directory above the openmalaria sources and rename to "zlib".
 * CMake 2.4 or 2.6 - use the installer from [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html here].
 * Python - download from [http://www.python.org here].

NB: The unit tests have a dependency on yaml-cpp (for reading in data for the vector tests). If you disable OM_CXXTEST_ENABLE (a CMake option), you won't need to install yaml-cpp.

= Build =

Create a new folder to build in (normally openmalaria/build but it doesn't have to be). Start the cmake-gui, set the source and build directories, and click configure. Tell CMake what kind of build system to generate (we've only tested Visual Studio 2005). Probably sort a few things, click configure again and then generate.

Inside the build folder, you should find a visual studio OpenMalaria.sln file. Use this to build. Due to some generated sources in the project not always getting built first, you should firstly build the "xsdcxx" target, then you can build "ALL_BUILD". If you want to run the tests, just build "RUN_TESTS".

== Compiling with Visual Studio ==

Navigate to your build directory and open "OpenMalaria.sln". Build like normal. Note: if Visual Studio tells you the project has been modified externally, you MUST reload (don't ignore), then build again.

You can select the Debug/Release/... build target, but it seems you have to rebuild when changing this.

= Compiling without a .net dependency =
(Ignore this section unless you *know* you want to do this. It's mostly notes to make a BOINC release version with minimal dependencies.)

Compile xerces statically with the following macro: XML_LIBRARY

In the cmake configuration for OpenMalaria:
 * set OM_USE_LIBCMT to true
 * edit {{{CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_*}}} (whichever build mode you're interested in): change "/MD" to "/MT" (or "/MDd" to "/MTd")
