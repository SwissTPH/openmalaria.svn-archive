#summary Overview of models

= Overview =

The diagrams here are overviews of models' processes. They don't go into much detail,
and all model-specific behaviour is abstracted under one block. More detailed graphs restricted to
the components of interest are available on some of the sub-model pages.

Color key: green arrows increase a quantity, red arrows decrease a quantity. Shape key: oval
nodes are processes affecting something, boxes surround models, and hexagonal nodes are
quantities without a process in view of the diagram.

== Infection cycle ==

This graph shows the infection cycle assumed by the model. Blood-stage parasite densities are
one of the most important aspects here. Intervention effects are not shown.

== Human population ==

The human population is regulated by the demography model (uses out-migrations to enforce
age-structure and births to keep population size constant).
