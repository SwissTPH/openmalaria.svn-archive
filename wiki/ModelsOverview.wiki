#summary Overview of models

= Overview =

== Simulation phases ==

Prior to simulating the outcomes of an intervention or steady-state scenario in what we term the *intervention phase*, our code runs through a warm-up phase. See [ModelTimeUpdates] for details.

== Diagrams ==

The diagrams here are overviews of models' processes. They don't go into much detail,
and all model-specific behaviour is abstracted under one block. More detailed graphs restricted to
the components of interest are available on some of the sub-model pages.

Color key: green arrows increase a quantity, red arrows decrease a quantity. Shape key: oval
nodes are processes affecting something, boxes surround models, and hexagonal nodes are
quantities without a process in view of the diagram.

=== Population-oriented views ===

Some perspectives for looking at model processes are those of [ModelDemography human population] processes or of [ModelTransmission#Vector_transmission mosquito population] processes.

=== Infection cycle ===

A common perspective is that of the malarial infection cycle. The following graph shows the cycle assumed by the model. Blood-stage parasite densities are
one of the most important aspects here. Intervention effects are not shown.
