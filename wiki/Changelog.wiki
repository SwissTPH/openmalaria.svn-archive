#summary Log of most significant changes between releases over time

= OpenMalaria releases =

== Schema Version 30 ==

Yet to be released. Planned changes:

  * Renamed Vector_EIR_Input and Vector_EIR_Simulated to inputEIR and simulatedEIR respectively.
  * Increased delay in human infectiousness model from the perspective of the non-vector model and several summaries: it appears it was one time-step short.
  * Bug fix in REPORT_ONLY_AT_RISK: after a case at time 0, times 2-5 were considered not-at-risk. This corrects those timesteps to 1-4.
  * `mode` parameter of `<entomology>` element now takes keyword value: `dynamic` or `forced`.
  * Vector model XML parameters now largely use elements instead of being one long string of attributes.
  * Vector parameters Î±_i, P_B_i, P_C_i and P_D_i (rate of encountering hosts and probabilities of biting, escaping and resting respectively) may now vary across humans to simulate human heterogeneity.


== Schema Version 29 ==

Released on 21st June as r1902.

  * New ITN model
  * MSAT for 5-day timestep.


== Schema Version 28 ==

Released on 24th May 2011 as r1836.

Big rearrangements of interventions content, moving from grouping by description
and deployment type to grouping by intervention. This should make experiment
design easier. Each intervention can optionally have a name attribute.

Changed some names:
  * drugDescription -> pharmacology
  * entoData -> entomology
  * eir -> EIR
  * monthlyEir -> monthlyEIR

Added optional name attributes to intervention descriptions.

New implementation of imported infections "intervention".

Larviciding intervention removed; it will be replaced by a more accurate model
later.


== Schema Version 27 ==

Released on 6th May 2011 as r1811.

  * Fix for Penny's infection model (code)
  * There should no longer be NaNs in output files when the model runs successfully
  * new continuous reporting option: median immunity Y
  * descriptions of vector interventions are no longer required in cases where the  intervention is never deployed
  * bug fix: initialize microscopy count
  * made transmission warm-up fitting problems interrupt the program again
