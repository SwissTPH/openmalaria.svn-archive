#summary Experiments: design, etc.

= Simulating experiments =

The OpenMalaria simulator is designed for simulating individual scenarios. To simulate a study covering variations in several factors, we usually design a fully factorial experiment. Terminology:

<dl>
  <dt>Sweep</dt>
  <dd>A *sweep* is one or more covarying factors, and the set of all arms of this sweep.</dd>
  <dt>Arm</dt>
  <dd>Each sweep must have one or (usually) more values for each of its factors. An *arm* is one of these combinations of values â€” a configuration assigning a value to each factor on the sweep.</dd>
  <dt>Experiment</dt>
  <dd>Largely synonymous with a study, an *experiment* is the complete description of all sweeps and arms used, together with the scenarios generated and results produced. Each scenario is generated by choosing one arm for each sweep in the experiment.</dd>
  <dt>Full factorial design</dt>
  <dd>A *full factorial* experiment is one where all possible scenarios are generated: all combinations of one arm per sweep are used.</dd>
  <dt>Seed</dt>
  <dd>Each time a scenario is simulated, the (psuedo-)random number generator must be started from some *seed* (generally a positive integer); using a different seed will affect the generation of each pseudo-random number and correspondingly may alter the outcome of stochastic decisions. Additionally, in saying that an experiment was run with 5 *seeds*, we mean that each scenario was run 5 times, each time with a different seed.</dd>

== Models and seeds ==

We are assembling a collection of many different models or parameterizations designed to take account of model uncertainties.

Since OpenMalaria simulations are stochastic, we usually use a number of random seeds (say 2-50) to provide estimates of the contributions of random variation to the results.
