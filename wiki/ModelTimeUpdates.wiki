#summary Explanation of simulation phases and updates with respect to times

= Simulation phases =

== Set-up ==

At time _t_=0, the human and (if using the vector model) mosquito populations are created.

== Warm-up ==

The simulation is run with enforced transmission until _t_=_tWL_ (that is, the simulation's state at times _t_=1 through to _t_=_tWL_ are calculated).

_tWL_ is calculated to be:

 * at least as long as the human life span (given as an attribute to the scenario's `<demography>` element)
 * at least as long as the warmup length requested by the transmission model
 * a whole number of years
