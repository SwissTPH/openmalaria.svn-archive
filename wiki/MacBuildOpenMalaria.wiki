#summary Brief build instructions for MAC OSX.

= Dependencies =

Dependencies are  similar to those required for the unix build [UnixBuildOpenMalaria unix]. However, be aware that several libraries and toolkits haven't yet been ported over to Mac snow leopard, and in particular, for Xcode 4.3 does not support the gcc compilers. 

For instance, you will need to build python GTK, which  is required to build the openmalariaTools front end.  If you insist, be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get a cup of coffee before diving in. Better yet,  save yourself some trouble, and run openmalaria and openmalariaTools  under ubuntu on a linux virtual machine.


= Backward compatibility =

In cmake you have to specify the older SDK version you would like to use to ensure backward compatibility.
Please beware of the fact that boinc won't be usable with SKDs < 10.3.9. Use the flag CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT to specify which SDK you would like to use.

= Building =

After checking out the source, code, and building all the dependencies that haven't yet been ported to MAC OSX,  you have two options to build openmalaria:
 * Use Xcode (see below)
 * Use Makefiles (see the [UnixBuildOpenMalaria unix] page)

= Building static binaries =

Whether you use Xcode or Makefiles, for the static build, xerces needs to be linked with the Carbon Framework. In cmake you can add extra Linker parameters using CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS and adding *-framework Carbon*


== Xcode ==

 * Run cmake-gui
  * set the source dir, and the build dir (suggested: SOURCE_DIR/build; if this doesn't exist cmake will invite  you to create it)
  * Run configure. Set the build system to Xcode.
  * Either disable OM_CXXTEST_ENABLE or install [http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/ yaml-cpp] 
  * Configure as described in the linux/unix instructions, and generate
 * From the build dir, open openmalaria.xcodeproj
  * Build the xsdcxx target (select libxsdcxx.a as the active target; build).
  * Then build the rest with the ALL_BUILD target.
  * Run the tests by building the RUN_TESTS target.
 * If cmake regenerates the project for some reason, you need to reload it in Xcode. Sometimes it will ask you, but sometimes it *won't* (and you need to manually reload the project in xcode).
