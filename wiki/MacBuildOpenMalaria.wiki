#summary Brief build instructions for the mac.

= Dependencies =

This is similar to [UnixBuildOpenMalaria unix].

Additionally, you should install [http://python.org/download/ python 2.6] (just download and run the mac installer). Python 3.0 doesn't work at the moment.

= Building =

After checking out the sources, you have two options to build openmalaria (at least, two that have been tested):
 * Use Xcode (see below)
 * Use Makefiles (see the [UnixBuildOpenMalaria unix] page)

== Xcode ==

 * Run cmake-gui
  * set the source dir, and the build dir (suggested: SOURCE_DIR/build; if this doesn't exist cmake will ask if you want to create it)
  * Run configure. Set the build system to Xcode.
  * You either need to disable OM_CXXTEST_ENABLE or install [http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/ yaml-cpp] for now (this may change)
  * Configure, and generate
 * From the build dir, open openmalaria.xcodeproj
  * First you need to build the xsdcxx target (select libxsdcxx.a as the active target; build).
  * Then you can build the rest with the ALL_BUILD target.
  * You can run the tests by building the RUN_TESTS target (currently doesn't appear to work).
 * If cmake regenerates the project for some reason, you need to reload it in Xcode. Sometimes it will ask you, *but sometimes it won't* (and you need to manually reload the project in xcode).
