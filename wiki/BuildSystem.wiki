#summary Building and Testing OpenMalaria

== Building OpenMalaria ==
 * [UnixBuildOpenMalaria On Unix]
 * [WindowsBuildOpenMalaria On Windows]
 * [MacBuildOpenMalaria On Mac] (addition to unix instructions)

Additionally, there's a [UnixBuildWindows summary] of how I tried (and failed) to cross-compile Windows binaries from linux, and some old documentation of how to [LinuxCompiling build openmalaria on linux].

=== Running the tests ===
CMake creates a build target which is never actually built, but "building" this target will run any integrated tests which are enabled. You can run this by:
 * _(Makefiles)_ `make test`
 * _(IDEs)_ Build the `RUN_TESTS` target.
 * _(From a command line)_ Run `ctest`. This has the advantage that you can use options like `-R` to select individual tests to run.
Unfortunately, none of these methods give you very much information about why tests fail. So to see details of why the last test run failed, look at the `BUILD_DIR/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log` file.
