Precompiled Binaries for windows, macosx and linux.

= Introduction =

It's now possible to download Precompiled Binaries from the openmalaria repository.
You can either choose to download the binaries and then run the scientific application using the terminal or to download the all in one installer including a GUI (openmalaria tools) for the interaction with the openmalaria application.

= Binaries only =

Start by making a folder wherever you want to use OpenMalaria. Then, you need to download one of the archives here (The links given point to the latest versions):

 * [http://openmalaria.googlecode.com/svn/download/openmalariaApps/openmalaria-647/win32/openmalaria-647.zip win32]
 * [http://openmalaria.googlecode.com/svn/download/openmalariaApps/openmalaria-647/macosx/openmalaria-647.zip macosx]
 * [http://openmalaria.googlecode.com/svn/download/openmalariaApps/openmalaria-647/gnu32/openmalaria-647.tar.gz gnu32]
 * [http://openmalaria.googlecode.com/svn/download/openmalariaApps/openmalaria-647/gnu64/openmalaria-647.tar.gz gnu64]

Extract whichever you download into your openmalaria folder and then run the openmalaria executable from a command line (see [SetupOverview Getting Started]).

It is now possible to test a new application for creating and running experiments locally. The tool is currently in Beta phase (beta 2) and could present some bugs. This tool allows the user to execute, create, monitor experiments using a GUI instead of a terminal or the command line. The Application was first written on linux using pyGTK but is usable on windows. An installer is given for the windows version.

The beta 3 is using the schema version 21 and the linux installer will follow.

You can download the latest installer here:

The new installer (since beta 2) doesn't need some python tools installation anymore. You still need to have java installed on your computer.

== Errors ==

Note that, for windows, you may well have to install the .net framework (if trying to run openMalaria as above gives you an error message like "reinstall the application", try this). The most straightforward way of getting this seems to be to search for .net, go to the microsoft link, and click download.

If this doesn't help, please contact us (or better, open an [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/issues/list issue]) with the error message. There's quite a few possible reasons it won't work and these binaries aren't well tested, so you'd help us out!

== What's what (files) ==

Now it works, I should tell you what all the files are:

|| openMalaria[.exe]|| binary files (executable)||
|| scenario_VER.xsd || schema file (formally describes what the xml files may contain); currently version 21 is used while 22 is under development ||
|| scenario.xml || An example scenario document (this one is simply a copy of examples/scenarioVecFullTestII.xml) ||
|| autoRegressionParameters.csv, densities.csv || auxiliary data files for openmalaria ||
