#summary Downloads: OpenMalaria and various other tools

= OpenMalaria simulator =

The simulator itself can be:

  * [openmalariaTools installed and used with OpenMalariaTools] (easiest to use)
  * [BuildSystem compiled from source]
  * run over BOINC ([http://malariacontrol.net/ join our volunteer computing effort])

We can also make packages with just the OpenMalaria simulator and few examples available for win32/OS X/linux 32/64-bit platforms. Please ask if none of the links above provide what you need (because you're using a Mac or need a newer version).

== Troubleshooting ==

Note that, for windows, you may well have to install the .net framework (if trying to run OpenMalaria as above gives you an error message like "reinstall the application", try this). You can download this from the [http://www.microsoft.com/net/ Microsoft .net page].

If this doesn't help, please contact us (or better, open an [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/issues/list issue]) with the error message.


= Experiment creator =

The experiment creator tool is designed to produce a full set of XML files for an experiment from a set of sweeps (factors) each with one or more arms (values). 

It is: integrated into OpenMalariaTools? Usable as a stand-alone download?

= Schema translator =

The scenario updater tool, SchemaTranslator, is integrated into OpenMalariaTools and used automatically when running old scenario files.

Can it also be used manually from OpenMalariaTools? Can it also be used stand-alone?
