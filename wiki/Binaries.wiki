Precompiled Binaries for windows, macosx and linux.

= Introduction =

It's now possible to download Precompiled Binaries from the openmalaria repository.

Start by making a folder wherever you want to use OpenMalaria. Then, you need to download one of the archives here: [http://openmalaria.googlecode.com/svn/download] (latest version recommended).

 * win32.zip
 * macosx.tar.bz2 / .tgz
 * linux32.tar.bz2

Extract whichever you download into your openmalaria folder. Within this, move everything in the common folder into the one above (alongside the executable). On windows, you should be able to (double) click on the runOpenMalaria.bat file to test the program will run (if not, see below). On other platforms, this doesn't appear to work but you can run it from a command line (see [SetupOverview Getting Started]).

== Errors ==

Note that, for windows, you may well have to install the .net framework (if trying to run openMalaria as above gives you an error message like "reinstall the application", try this). The most straightforward way of getting this seems to be to search for .net, go to the microsoft link, and click download.

If this doesn't help, please contact us (or better, open an [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/issues/list issue]) with the error message. There's quite a few possible reasons it won't work and these binaries aren't well tested, so you'd help us out!

== What's what (files) ==

Now it works, I should tell you what all the files are:

|| openMalaria[.exe], any .dll files || binary files (executable & libraries) ||
|| runOpenMalaria.bat/.sh || script file for running openmalaria (see [SetupOverview Getting Started]) ||
|| scenario_VER.xsd || schema file (formally describes what the xml files may contain); currently version 17 is used while 18 is under development ||
|| scenario.xml || An example scenario document (this one is simply a copy of examples/scenarioVecFullTestII.xml) ||
|| autoRegressionParameters.csv, densities.csv || auxiliary data files for openmalaria ||
