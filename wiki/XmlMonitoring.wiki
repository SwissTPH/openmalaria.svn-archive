#summary Tables of monitoring option codes and descriptions

([XmlScenario Back to scenario file description.])

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Monitoring options =

The monitoring system is described [Monitoring here] and within the [XmlScenario#Monitoring_element:_monitoring scenario configuration reference].

== Continuous measures ==

This output format was introduced in schema version 19; some outputs were added later. There's no central list of these outputs in the code; instead search for calls to `Continuous::registerCallback` -- it's first argument should correspond to the output identifier in the table below.

The following outputs are currently available, and can be enabled by adding a sub-element to `continuous` within the monitoring section of the XML, for example:
{{{
<continuous period="1">
  <option name="input EIR" value="true"/>
</continuous>
}}}

All options not otherwise specified are point-time outputs.

|| output || description ||
|| recent births || Number of new humans since last report ||
|| N_v0 || The mosquito emergence rate ||
|| N_v || The number of mosquitoes ||
|| O_v || The number of infected mosquitoes ||
|| S_v || The number of infectious mosquitoes ||
|| input EIR || Total entomological infection rate input. This is a fixed periodic value, for comparison with simulated EIR. Units (from schema version 24): inoculations per adult per timestep. ||
|| simulated EIR || EIR actually acting on humans, as calculated by the transmission model. Units: inoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| human infectiousness || Infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes, also known as kappa. This is the probability of a mosquito biting a human from becoming infected. ||
|| human availability || Mean availability of humans to mosquitoes over human population. ||
|| immunity h || Average of `_cumulativeh` parameter across humans, which is the cumulative number of infections recieved since birth ||
|| immunity Y || Average of `_cumulativeY` parameter across humans, which is the cumulative parasite density since birth ||
|| new infections || Number of new infections since last report, including super infections as with survey measure 43. ||

== Survey measures ==

The `SurveyOptions` element controls which survey measures are [OutputFiles#measures output]. Omitting an option has the same effect as listing it with value "false". The "measure" in the table should be input into the XML to enable an output, which will appear in the `output.txt` with a numeric "id" (also below). Configuration example:
{{{
<SurveyOptions>
  <option name="nHost" value="true"/>
  <option name="nPatent" value="true"/>
</SurveyOptions>
}}}

These tables come from
[http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/source/browse/trunk/include/Monitoring/Survey.h this file]
in the code. The "second column" column indicates the meaning of the contents
of the second column of [OutputFiles output files]. The "cohort" column
indicates whether, when cohort mode is enabled, this output is restricted to
the cohort; if false, it is unaffected by the cohort mode. A number means that from this schema version output is restricted to the cohort.

|| id || measure || second column || cohort || description ||
||  0 || nHost  || age group || y || Total number of humans. *Note*: when using the `IPTI_SP_MODEL` option, humans not at risk of a further episode due to having had a recent episode within the health-system-memory period are subtracted from this and several other outputs (only applies to the `IPTI_SP_MODEL`). ||
||  1 || nInfect  || age group || y || number of infected hosts  ||
|| 2 || nExpectd  || age group || y ||  expected number of infected hosts ||
|| 3 || nPatent  || age group || y || number of patent hosts ||

|| 6 || totalInfs  || age group || y|| Total infections ||
|| 7 || nTransmit || (unused) ||n|| Infectiousness of human population to mosquitoes. Number of hosts transmitting to mosquitoes (i.e. sum of proportion of mosquitoes that get infected). Single value, not per age-group. ||
|| 8 || totalPatentInf  || age group ||y||  Total patent infections ||

|| 20 || nEPIVaccinations || age group ||24||  number of EPI vaccine doses given ||
|| 21 || allCauseIMR || (unused) || n || all cause infant mortality rate (returned as a single number over whole intervention period, instead of from a survey interval) ||

|| 29 || || || || (removed) ||
|| 30 || innoculationsPerAgeGroup || age group ||n|| The total number of inoculations per age group, summed over the reporting period. ||

Vector model outputs. These were point-time outputs, but some (just EIR?) have been converted to output averages.

The Nv0, Nv, Ov and Sv outputs are per-species; the EIR outputs are single values.

|| id || measure || second column || cohort || description ||
|| 31 || Vector_Nv0 || vector species || n || Mosquito emergence rate. ||
|| 32 || Vector_Nv  || vector species || n ||  Mosquito population size ||
|| 33 || Vector_Ov  || vector species || n ||  Number of infected mosquitoes ||
|| 34 || Vector_Sv  || vector species || n ||  Number of infectious mosquitoes ||
|| 35 || Vector_EIR_Input  || (unused) || n ||  Input EIR (Expected EIR entered into scenario file). Units (from schema version 24): inoculations per adult per timestep. ||
|| 36 || Vector_EIR_Simulated  || (unused) || n ||  Simulated EIR (EIR output by the vector model). Units: inoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| 37 || || || || (removed) ||

|| 43 || nNewInfections || age group || y || The number of infections introduced since the last survey, per age group. This counts super-infections without the usual limit of 21 concurrent infections, so in some ways is similar to introduction of infections in an infinite population. ||
|| 44 || nMassITNs || age group ||24|| The number of ITNs delivered by mass distribution since last survey. ||
