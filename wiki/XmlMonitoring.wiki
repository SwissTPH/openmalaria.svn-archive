= Monitoring options =

The monitoring system is described [Monitoring here] and within the [XmlScenario#Monitoring_element:_monitoring scenario configuration reference].

== Units ==

=== Special output values ===

Some outputs are the result of averaging a measure over simulated individuals for a specified duration. If the denominator number of individuals in this average is zero, the resulting value isn't valid, so an output value of *nan* (or "-nan" - short for Not A Number) is reported.
To make detection of computation errors easier, we try to avoid outputting *nan* values in discrete survey outputs. The same is not true for continuous outputs: several of these may output *nan* values at the beginning of the simulation or other times.

For the drug costing measures no value is listed at all for drugs never prescribed since the last survey.

=== EIR ===

The units we generally use for EIR are _entomological inoculations per time period as measured in adults_ where the time period may be days, years, or the model's time step (currently 1 or 5 days).

Since children are smaller than adults our model assumes they are less likely to be bitten by mosquitoes. However, most information we have on EIR tends to be measured in adults. We try to make our units equivalent, either by only considering bites in adults or by scaling the mean availability of all people in the population compared to an adult (this mean relative availability is the "human availability" output available in continuous-reporting mode).

== Continuous measures ==

This output format was introduced in schema version 19; some outputs were added later. There's no central list of these outputs in the code; instead search for calls to `Continuous::registerCallback` -- it's first argument should correspond to the output identifier in the table below.

The following outputs are currently available, and can be enabled by adding a sub-element to `continuous` within the monitoring section of the XML, for example:
{{{
<continuous period="1">
  <option name="input EIR" value="true"/>
</continuous>
}}}

All options not otherwise specified are point-time outputs.

== Survey measures ==

The `SurveyOptions` element controls which survey measures are [OutputFiles#measures output]. Omitting an option has the same effect as listing it with value "false". The "measure" in the table should be input into the XML to enable an output, which will appear in the `output.txt` with a numeric "id" (also below). Configuration example:
{{{
<SurveyOptions>
  <option name="nHost" value="true"/>
  <option name="nPatent" value="true"/>
</SurveyOptions>
}}}

These tables come from
[http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/source/browse/trunk/include/Monitoring/Survey.h this file]
in the code. The "second column" column indicates the meaning of the contents
of the second column of [OutputFiles output files]. The "cohort" column
indicates whether, when cohort mode is enabled, this output is restricted to
the cohort; if false, it is unaffected by the cohort mode. A number means that from this schema version output is restricted to the cohort.
