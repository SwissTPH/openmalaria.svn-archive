== Continuous measures ==

This output format was introduced in schema version 19; some outputs were added later. There's no central list of these outputs in the code; instead search for calls to `Continuous::registerCallback` -- it's first argument should correspond to the output identifier in the table below.

The following outputs are currently available, and can be enabled by adding a sub-element to `continuous` within the monitoring section of the XML, for example:
{{{
<continuous period="1">
  <option name="input EIR" value="true"/>
</continuous>
}}}

All options not otherwise specified are point-time outputs.

|| output || description ||
|| recent births || Number of new humans since last report ||
|| N_v0 || The mosquito emergence rate ||
|| N_v || The number of mosquitoes ||
|| O_v || The number of infected mosquitoes ||
|| S_v || The number of infectious mosquitoes ||
|| input EIR || Total entomological infection rate input. This is a fixed periodic value, for comparison with simulated EIR. Units: innoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| simulated EIR || EIR actually acting on humans, as calculated by the transmission model. Units: innoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| human infectiousness || Infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes, also known as kappa. This is the probability of a mosquito biting a human from becoming infected. ||
|| human availability || Mean availability of humans to mosquitoes over human population. ||
|| immunity h || Average of `_cumulativeh` parameter across humans, which is the cumulative number of infections recieved since birth ||
|| immunity Y || Average of `_cumulativeY` parameter across humans, which is the cumulative parasite density since birth ||
|| new infections || Number of new infections since last report, including super infections as with survey measure 43. ||

== Survey measures ==

The `SurveyOptions` element controls which survey measures are [OutputFiles#measures output]. Omitting an option has the same effect as listing it with value "false". The "measure" in the table should be input into the XML to enable an output, which will appear in the `output.txt` with a numeric "id" (also below). Configuration example:
{{{
<SurveyOptions>
  <option name="nHost" value="true"/>
  <option name="nPatent" value="true"/>
</SurveyOptions>
}}}

These tables come from [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/source/browse/trunk/include/Monitoring/Survey.h this file] in the code. The "cohort" column indicates whether, when cohort mode is enabled, this output is restricted to the cohort; if false, it is unaffected by the cohort mode.

|| id || measure || cohort || description ||
||  0 || nHost  || y || Total number of humans. *Note*: when using the `IPTI_SP_MODEL` option, humans not at risk of a further episode due to having had a recent episode within the health-system-memory period are subtracted from this and several other outputs (only applies to the `IPTI_SP_MODEL`). ||
||  1 || nInfect  || y || number of infected hosts  ||
|| 2 || nExpectd  || y ||  expected number of infected hosts ||
|| 3 || nPatent  || y || number of patent hosts ||
|| 4 || sumLogPyrogenThres || y ||  Sum of the log of the pyrogen threshold ||
|| 5 || sumlogDens  || y||  Sum of the logarithm of the parasite density ||
|| 6 || totalInfs  || y|| Total infections ||
|| 7 || nTransmit ||n|| Infectiousness of human population to mosquitoes. Number of hosts transmitting to mosquitoes (i.e. sum of proportion of mosquitoes that get infected). Single value, not per age-group. ||
|| 8 || totalPatentInf  ||y||  Total patent infections ||
|| 10 || sumPyrogenThresh  ||y||  Sum of the pyrogenic threshold ||
|| 11 || nTreatments1  ||n|| 5-day timestep model: number of treatments (1st line) ||
|| 12 || nTreatments2  ||n|| 5-day timestep model: number of treatments (2nd line) ||
|| 13 || nTreatments3  ||n|| 5-day timestep model: number of treatments (inpatient) ||
|| 14 || nUncomp  ||n||  number of episodes (uncomplicated) ||
|| 15 || nSevere  ||n||  number of episodes (severe) ||
|| 16 || nSeq  ||n||  cases with sequelae ||
|| 17 || nHospitalDeaths  ||n||  deaths in hospital ||
|| 18 || nIndDeaths  ||n||  number of deaths (indirect) ||
|| 19 || nDirDeaths  ||n||  number of deaths (direct) ||
|| 20 || nEPIVaccinations ||n ||  number of EPI vaccine doses given ||
|| 21 || allCauseIMR || n || all cause infant mortality rate (returned as a single number over whole intervention period, instead of from a survey interval) ||
|| 22 || nMassVaccinations  ||n||  number of Mass / Campaign vaccine doses given ||
|| 23 || nHospitalRecovs  ||n||  recoveries in hospital ||
|| 24 || nHospitalSeqs  ||n||  sequelae in hospital ||
|| 25 || nIPTDoses  || n|| number of IPT Doses ||
|| 26 || annAvgK   || n|| Annual Average Kappa. Calculated once a year as sum of human infectiousness divided by initial EIR summed over a year. Single value, not per age-group. ||
|| 27 || nNMFever  || n ||  Number of episodes of non-malaria fever ||
|| 28 || || || (removed) ||
|| 29 || || || (removed) ||
|| 30 || innoculationsPerAgeGroup ||n|| The total number of inoculations per age group, summed over the reporting period. ||

Vector model outputs. These were point-time outputs, but some (just EIR?) have been converted to output averages.

The Nv0, Nv, Ov and Sv outputs are per-species; the EIR outputs are single values.

|| id || measure || cohort || description ||
|| 31 || Vector_Nv0 || n || Mosquito emergence rate. ||
|| 32 || Vector_Nv  || n ||  Mosquito population size ||
|| 33 || Vector_Ov  || n ||  Number of infected mosquitoes ||
|| 34 || Vector_Sv  || n ||  Number of infectious mosquitoes ||
|| 35 || Vector_EIR_Input  || n ||  Input EIR (Expected EIR entered into scenario file). Units: innoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| 36 || Vector_EIR_Simulated  || n ||  Simulated EIR (EIR output by the vector model). Units: innoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| 37 || || || (removed) ||
|| 38 || || || (removed) ||
|| 39 || Clinical_RDTs  || n ||  Number of Rapid Diagnostic Tests used ||
|| 40 || Clinical_DrugUsage  || n ||  Quantities of drugs used, per active ingredient abbreviation ||
|| 41 || Clinical_FirstDayDeaths  || n ||  Direct death on first day of CM (before treatment takes effect) ||
|| 42 || Clinical_HospitalFirstDayDeaths  || n ||  Direct death on first day of CM (before treatment takes effect); hospital only ||
|| 43 || nNewInfections || y || The number of infections introduced since the last survey, per age group. This counts super-infections without the usual limit of 21 concurrent infections, so in some ways is similar to introduction of infections in an infinite population. ||
|| 44 || nMassITNs || n || The number of ITNs delivered by mass distribution since last survey. ||
|| 45 || nEPI_ITNs || n || The number of ITNs delivered through EPI since last survey. ||
|| 46 || nMassIRS || n || The number of people newly protected by IRS since last survey. ||
|| 47 || nMassVA || n || The number of people newly protected by a vector-availability intervention since the last survey. ||
|| 48 || Clinical_Microscopy  || n ||  Number of microscopy tests used ||
