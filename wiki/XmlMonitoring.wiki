= Monitoring options =

The monitoring system is described [Monitoring here] and within the [XmlScenario#Monitoring_element:_monitoring scenario configuration reference].

== Units ==

=== EIR ===

The units we generally use for EIR are _entomological inoculations per time period as measured in adults_ where the time period may be days, years, or the model's time step (currently 1 or 5 days).

Since children are smaller than adults our model assumes they are less likely to be bitten by mosquitoes. Since EIR only tends to be measured in adults, we try to make our units equivalent, either by only considering bites in adults or by dividing by the mean availability of people in the population compared to an adult (this mean relative availability is the "human availability" output available in continuous-reporting mode).

== Continuous measures ==

This output format was introduced in schema version 19; some outputs were added later. There's no central list of these outputs in the code; instead search for calls to `Continuous::registerCallback` -- it's first argument should correspond to the output identifier in the table below.

The following outputs are currently available, and can be enabled by adding a sub-element to `continuous` within the monitoring section of the XML, for example:
{{{
<continuous period="1">
  <option name="input EIR" value="true"/>
</continuous>
}}}

All options not otherwise specified are point-time outputs.

|| output || description ||
|| recent births || Number of new humans since last report ||
|| N_v0 || The mosquito emergence rate ||
|| N_v || The number of mosquitoes ||
|| O_v || The number of infected mosquitoes ||
|| S_v || The number of infectious mosquitoes ||
|| input EIR || Total entomological infection rate input. This is a fixed periodic value, for comparison with simulated EIR. Units (from schema version 24): inoculations per adult per timestep. ||
|| simulated EIR || EIR actually acting on humans, as calculated by the transmission model. Units: from schema version 26, inoculations per adult per timestep, previously inoculations per person per timestep. ||
|| human infectiousness || Infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes, also known as kappa. This is the probability that a mosquito becomes infected at any single feed on a human. ||
|| human availability || Mean availability of humans to mosquitoes compared to a human adult. ||
|| immunity h || Average of `_cumulativeh` parameter across humans, which is the cumulative number of infections received since birth ||
|| immunity Y || Average of `_cumulativeY` parameter across humans, which is the cumulative parasite density since birth ||
|| new infections || Number of new infections since last report, including super infections as with survey measure 43. ||

== Survey measures ==

The `SurveyOptions` element controls which survey measures are [OutputFiles#measures output]. Omitting an option has the same effect as listing it with value "false". The "measure" in the table should be input into the XML to enable an output, which will appear in the `output.txt` with a numeric "id" (also below). Configuration example:
{{{
<SurveyOptions>
  <option name="nHost" value="true"/>
  <option name="nPatent" value="true"/>
</SurveyOptions>
}}}

These tables come from
[http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/source/browse/trunk/include/Monitoring/Survey.h this file]
in the code. The "second column" column indicates the meaning of the contents
of the second column of [OutputFiles output files]. The "cohort" column
indicates whether, when cohort mode is enabled, this output is restricted to
the cohort; if false, it is unaffected by the cohort mode. A number means that from this schema version output is restricted to the cohort.

|| id || measure || second column || cohort || description ||
||  0 || nHost  || age group || y || Total number of humans. *Note*: when using the `IPTI_SP_MODEL` option, humans not at risk of a further episode due to having had a recent episode within the health-system-memory period are subtracted from this and several other outputs (only applies to the `IPTI_SP_MODEL`). ||
||  1 || nInfect  || age group || y || number of infected hosts  ||

Vector model outputs. These were point-time outputs, but some (just EIR?) have been converted to output averages.

The Nv0, Nv, Ov and Sv outputs are per-species; the EIR outputs are single values.

|| 34 || Vector_Sv  || vector species || n ||  Number of infectious mosquitoes ||
|| 35 || Vector_EIR_Input  || (unused) || n ||  Input EIR (Expected EIR entered into scenario file). Units (from schema version 24): inoculations per adult per timestep. ||
|| 36 || Vector_EIR_Simulated  || (unused) || n ||  Simulated EIR (EIR output by the vector model). Units: from schema version 26, inoculations per adult per timestep, previously inoculations per person per timestep. ||
