#summary Transmission models

= Transmission =

The transmission models cover inter-human transmission of malaria, from measuring human infectiousness to mosquitoes to the point of describing each human's exposure (as inoculations per person per year, denoted EIR: Entomological Infection Rate), potentially taking the human's relative availability to mosquitoes into account in both cases.  The simulator is designed to simulate seasonally forced transmission, i.e. we assume that in the absence of interventions the EIR recurs annually with the same seasonal pattern.

We currently have two transmission models: `NonVectorTransmission` and `VectorTransmission`.

== Non-vector transmission ==

The 'Non-vector transmission' sub-model can be used only when there are no interventions affecting the vectorial capacity.  

This model assumes that the mosquito population acts to distribute infections at random to the human population (with human exposure proportionate to availability).  There is a fixed time lag between infection of the mosquito and transmission to humans, corresponding to the duration of the sporogonic cycle in the mosquito.  The effect on transmission of interventions on the human population is simulated by changing the infectiousness to mosquitoes. 
 
The average human infectiousness to mosquitoes, denoted `kappa`, is measured by the function `updateKappa`, according to the formula
{{{
kappa = sum_{i in pop}( alpha_i * kappa_i ) / sum_i( alpha_i )
}}}
where `pop` is the human population, `alpha_i` is the availability of human `i` relative to the population's mean availability, and `kappa_i` is the infectiousness of human `i` (units?).

The Entomological Infection Rate can be calculated in three modes: `equilibriumMode`, where the daily EIR from the scenario file is used directly, `transientEIRknown`, where, similarly, EIR data from a `changeEIR` intervention in scenario file is used directly, and `dynamicEIR`. The `equilibriumMode` is always used for the initialisation phase, during which `kappa` data per day of year is collected and stored in `initialKappa`. When commencing the intervention phase of the simulation, the mode is usually switched to `dynamicEIR`, which uses the same EIR data as in `equilibriumMode` but scales this by `kappa_d / initialKappa_d` where `d` is the day-of-year.

== Vector transmission ==

Simulations that include non-periodic changes in the vectorial capacity use a seasonally forced version of the model for vector dynamics of [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a795158564&db=all Chitnis et al (2008)Journal of Biological Dynamics Vol. 2, No. 3, July 2008, 259â€“285].
