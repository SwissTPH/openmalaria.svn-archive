Openmalaria's pathogenesis models determines the onset of sickness episodes (termed sickness events) based on parasite density. Different models are implemented including:

 * *Base pathogenesis model* This is a stochastic model that relates the probability of a clinical attack of malaria to the peripheral parasite densities via a pyrogenic threshold that itself responds dynamically to the parasite load. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16931816 Smith et al, 2006] (this is implemented in the `PyrogenPathogenesis` class): The parameters of the model have been estimated by fitting it to the relationship between incidence of clinical episodes and the entomologic inoculation rate, using age-specific incidence data from two villages in Senegal and one village in Tanzania.
 * *Mueller pathogenesis model* This is a stochastic model that uses a log-linear function of parasite densities to determine the probability of a clinical episode, based on equations fitted by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19602275 Mueller et al, 2009] to data from Papua New Guinea (this is implemented in the `MuellerPathogenesis` class).
 * Predetermined episodes presentation model (`PredetPathogenesis` class).
