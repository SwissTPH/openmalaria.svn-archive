#summary Design of scenarios and XML configuration

= Design of scenario configuration =

OpenMalaria is designed to run small-medium scale independent simulations. If you want to design an experiment evaluating the impact of one of more factors, you may want to read about [ExperimentDesign designing experiments].

Within a simulation of a single setting, dubbed a _scenario_, there are a number of choices to make, outlined below. These choices are entered as XML elements. Removing much of the detail, such an XML file looks like this:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<scenario xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" analysisNo="0" assimMode="0" name="template scenario" schemaVersion="23" wuID="0" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="scenario_23.xsd">
  <demography ...>
    ...
  </demography>
  <monitoring name="Quarterly Surveys">
    ...
  </monitoring>
  <interventions name="Full Set">
    ...
  </interventions>
  <healthSystem>
    ...
  </healthSystem>
  <entoData ...>
    ...
  </entoData>
  <model>
    <ModelOptions>
      ...
    </ModelOptions>
    <clinical healthSystemMemory="6"/>
    <parameters interval="5" iseed="0" latentp="3">
      ...
    </parameters>
  </model>
</scenario>
}}}

This may be used as a template, adapting if necessary to the latest schema version.
