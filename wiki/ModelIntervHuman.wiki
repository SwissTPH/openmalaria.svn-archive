#summary Description of human-stage malarial interventions

= Human-stage interventions =

The following table lists interventions which have been implemented in OpenMalaria, and which deployment methods are available:

|| intervention || mass-deployment || continuous-deployment ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Change_health_system changeHS] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Vaccines vaccine] || yes || yes (see deployment notes) ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Mass_drug_administration MDA] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Intermittent_Preventative_Treatment IPT] || yes || yes ||

== Change heath system ==

This intervention updates the health-system by providing an entirely new description; e.g. it can be used to simulate the effects of improved access to treatment. The `changeHS` element takes exactly the same content as the [XmlScenario#Health_system:_healthSystem `healthSystem`] element used to describe the initial health system.


== Vaccines ==

Three vaccine types are simulated; this intervention administers all of these which have been configured to individuals (so changing the type of vaccine used during a simulation is not currently possible). Types of vaccine:

 * Pre-erythrocytic vaccine (vaccineType 1): prevents a proportion of infections from commencing.
 * Blood-stage vaccine (vaccineType 2): acts as a killing factor on blood-stage parasites
 * Transmission-blocking vaccine (vaccineType 3): one minus this scales the probability of transmission to mosquitoes

== Mass Drug Administration ==

MDA simply gives humans drugs. In the 5-day timestep models, these drugs are simply modelled (drug kills 100% of parasites in all patients receiving it with no lasting effect), while with the 1-day time-step model a drug dosage must be specified.

== Intermittent Preventive Treatment ==

IPTi and IPTc: Intermittent Preventative Treatment for infants/children. Somewhat similar to mass drug administration, but allows drugs to have a lasting (prophylactic) effect using the 5-day time-step model.

There is currently no equivalent for 1-day time-step models, since the PKPD model used for mass-drug administration already allows prophylactic effects.
