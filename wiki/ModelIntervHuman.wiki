#summary Description of human-stage malarial interventions

= Human-stage interventions =

The following table lists interventions which have been implemented in OpenMalaria, and which deployment methods are available:

|| intervention || mass-deployment || continuous-deployment ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Change_health_system changeHS] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Vaccines vaccine] || yes || yes (see deployment notes) ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Mass_drug_administration MDA] || yes || no ||
|| [ModelIntervHuman#Intermittent_Preventative_Treatment IPT] || yes || yes ||

== Change heath system ==

This intervention updates the health-system by providing an entirely new description; e.g. it can be used to simulate the effects of improved access to treatment. The `changeHS` element takes exactly the same content as the [XmlScenario#Health_system:_healthSystem healthSystem] element used to describe the initial health system.


== Vaccines ==

Three vaccine types are simulated; this intervention administers all of these which have been configured to individuals (so changing the type of vaccine used during a simulation is not currently possible). Types of vaccine:

 * Pre-erythrocytic vaccine (vaccineType 1): prevents a proportion of infections from commencing.
 * Blood-stage vaccine (vaccineType 2): acts as a killing factor on blood-stage parasites
 * Transmission-blocking vaccine (vaccineType 3): one minus this scales the probability of transmission to mosquitoes

Vaccines need to be configured per-scenario with one or more `vaccineDescription` elements within the `descriptions` element (up to one per `vaccineType`):
{{{
<vaccineDescription vaccineType="3">
  <halfLifeYrs value="10"/>
  <efficacyB value="10"/>
  <initialEfficacy value="0.512"/>
  <initialEfficacy value="0.64"/>
  <initialEfficacy value="0.8"/>
</vaccineDescription>
}}}
Each vaccine type described is administered. One or more `initialEfficacy` elements can be given specifying the efficacy of each subsequent dose of the vaccine administered (at the time of administration). If further doses are given, the last listed `initialEfficacy` is repeated.

Use standard [ModelInterventions#Continuous_descriptions continuous] description with name `vaccine` and [ModelInterventions#Timed_descriptions mass deployment] description with name `vaccinate`, although the interaction of the two deployment methods is not quite the same as with other continuously deployed interventions: if a dose has been received via mass deployment, it will not also be received via continuous deployment, and if a continuous dose is missed but later caught-up with through mass deployment, further continuous doses may also be received (continuous administration only treats individuals who have received all doses they should have through continuous programs).


== Mass Drug Administration ==

MDA simply gives humans drugs. In the 5-day timestep models, these drugs are simply modelled (drug kills 100% of parasites in all patients receiving it with no lasting effect), while with the 1-day time-step model a drug dosage must be specified.

When used with a 1-day time-step, the `MDADescription` element must be present within the interventions' descriptions element (format is the same as for a [ScenarioHealthSystem#treatments treatment schedule). Deployment uses the standard [ModelInterventions#Timed_descriptions mass-deployment] description with name `MDA`.
{{{
  <interventions name="cohort selection">
    <descriptions>
      <MDADescription>
        <schedule>
          <medicate drug="MQ" hour="0" mg="1200"/>
        </schedule>
      </MDADescription>
    </descriptions>
    <timed>
      <intervention time="730">
        <MDA coverage="0.6"/>
      </intervention>
    </timed>
  </interventions>
}}}


== Intermittent Preventive Treatment ==

IPTi and IPTc: Intermittent Preventative Treatment for infants/children. Somewhat similar to mass drug administration, but allows drugs to have a lasting (prophylactic) effect using the 5-day time-step model.

There is currently no equivalent for 1-day time-step models, since the PKPD model used for mass-drug administration already allows prophylactic effects.

IPT must be described per scenario with an `IPTDescription` element. Uses standard [ModelInterventions#Continuous_descriptions continuous] and [ModelInterventions#Timed_descriptions mass-deployment] descriptions with name `ipti`.
