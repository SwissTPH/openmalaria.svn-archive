#summary Decay functions used as part of intervention descriptions

= Decay functions =

Several interventions, such as bed nets and vaccines, have an effectiveness which
decays over time (at the population and possibly the individual level). To allow
use of different decay functions, a generalized method of describing decay was
added into schema version 25. The following set of functions are available:

|| function    || formula || L is time to || ||
|| constant    || `1` || || no decay ||
|| step        || `1` || full decay || for `t < L`, otherwise 0 ||
|| linear      || `1 - t/L` || full decay || for `t < L`, otherwise 0 ||
|| exponential || `exp( - t/L * log(2) )` || half decay || ||
|| weibull     || `exp( -(t/L)^k * log(2) )` || half decay || equivalent to exponential when `k = 1` ||
|| hill        || `1 / (1 + (t/L)^k)` || half decay || ||
|| smooth-compact || `exp( k - k / (1 - (t/L)^2) )` || full decay || for `t < L`, otherwise 0 ||

where `L` is a description of the rate of decay, either the time until half decay or the time until full decay (see above) in years, and `k` is a shape
parameter (no dimension).

The smooth compact and linear decay functions reach zero at time L, whereas the
Weibull, Hill and exponential functions never reach zero and have half their
original efficacies at time L.

== Configuration ==

In some 
Certain interventions have their efficacy decay described by an XML element of type `DecayFunction`, or by an element of type `DecayFunctionValue` which includes the initial value. These are of the form:

Examples for "eltName":

{{{
<eltName L="10.0" function="exponential"/>
<eltName L="3" function="weibull" k="1.5" initial="0.44"/>
}}}

In some uses, such as to describe the effects of bed nets, the decay-function's value must be multiplied by a parameter describing the level of effect before any decay; this is done by the `initial` attribute.

The `function`, `L` and `k` attributes act as described above, with `k` optional (defaults to `1` if not specified).

== Heterogeneity ==

Starting with version 26 of OpenMalaria, variations can be introduced into decay rate: a random variate x is sampled from the log-normal distribution, and t in the above formulas is replaced by t/x.

The attribute `sigma` can be specified as part of the decay-function description element: if this is non-zero, x is sampled as: `x ~ lnN(0,sigmaÂ²)`.
