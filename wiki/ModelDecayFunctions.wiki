#summary Decay functions used as part of intervention descriptions

= Decay functions =

Several interventions, such as bed nets and vaccines, have an effectiveness which
decays over time (at the population and possibly the individual level). To allow
use of different decay functions, a generalized method of describing decay was
added into schema version 25. The following set of functions are available:

|| xml name || formula || ||
|| constant || 1 || no decay ||
|| linear || 1 - t/L || for t less than L, otherwise 0 ||
|| exponential || exp( - t/L * log(2) ) || ||
|| weibull || exp( -(t/L)^k * log(2) ) || equivalent to exponential when k = 1 ||
|| hill || 1 / (1 + (t/L)^k) || ||
|| chitnis || exp( k - k / (1 - (t/L)^2) ) || for t less than L, otherwise 0 ||

where L is some description of the time-scale (dimension time) and k is a shape
parameter (no dimension).

Chitnis's function and the linear decay reach zero at time L, whereas the
Weibull, Hill and exponential functions never reach zero and have half their
original efficacies at time L.

== Configuration ==

Certain interventions have their efficacy decay described by an XML element of type `DecayFunction`, or by an element of type `DecayFunctionValue` which includes the initial value. These are of the form:

{{{
<eltName L="10.0" function="exponential"/>
<eltName L="3" function="weibull" k="1.5" initial="0.44"/>
}}}

The `initial` attribute is only valid for `DecayFunctionValue` elements. In both cases, `function` and `L` must be specified, while `k` is optional (defaulting to 1 if not specified).
