#summary Building xerces-c on ubuntu

= Introduction =

Normally, you can probably just install from packages:
{{{
apt-get install libxerces-c2-dev
}}}
If you don't want to...

= Details =
Both versions 2.8.x and 3.0.x should work, but both have given me plenty of problems, either while compiling or while linking (creating the openmalaria executable) using the resultant library. I don't know if older versions would work.

=== Install from mac ports ===
Note that installing a library multiple times from different sources isn't a good idea. If you already have xerces includes available on your system, they could get used along with a library from elsewhere, causing problems if the library is built from a different version of the source code.

Download and install macports from [http://www.macports.org/] or [http://darwinports.com/download/ darwinports].

Start the interactive shell:
{{{
sudo port -d selfupdate
sudo port
}}}
 * From the interactive port shell:
{{{
list xercesc
install xercesc
quit
}}}

Macports installs  into /opt/local without making libraries or includes here generally available - so you need to make them explicitly available.

 * make the library accessible
{{{
cd openMalaria/lib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libxerces-c.a ./
}}}
 * make the includes accessible
{{{
cd ../include
ln -s /opt/local/include/xercesc ./
}}}

=== Compile from source ===

As noted above, you don't have to use version 2.8., but if you did, the command to retrieve the source code would be:
{{{
wget http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/apache/dist/xerces/c/2/sources/xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar.gz
cd xerces-c-src_2_8_0/
export XERCESCROOT=`pwd`
cd src/xercesc
}}}
 * configure for linux:
{{{
./runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++ -minmem -nsocket -tnative -rpthread -s
}}}
 * configure for mac:
{{{
 ./runConfigure -pmacosx -cgcc -xg++ -minmem -nsocket -tnative -rpthread -s
}}}
Then build and install. If you are installing static libraries, put them in /usr/local/lib:
{{{
make
sudo make install
cd ../../..
}}}
