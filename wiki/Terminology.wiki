<wiki:comment>
We define items within a <dl>...</dl> list, in alphabetical order.
<dt>...</dt> tags introduce new items.
<dd>...</dd> tags hold a description of the last item.

Syntax:
  Use *bold* to highlight the definition of a term.
  Make other terms (listed here) in a description _italic_.

<dl>
  <dt>Arm</dt>
  <dd>Each sweep must have one or (usually) more values for each of its factors. An *arm* is one of these combinations of values â€” a configuration assigning a value to each factor on the sweep.</dd>
  <dt>Bout</dt>
  <dd>In our 1 day time-step clinical model, a *bout* of sickness is considered to be a fever or severe illness that usually lasts no more than 5 days. When an individual recovers (or dies), that bout is considered over. </dd>
  <dt>Component</dt>
  <dd>The simulator is divided up into several *components*: e.g. within-host, transmission, health-system. From a computing perspective these may be called _interfaces_.</dd>
  <dt>Episode</dt>
  <dd>The health-system's reporting unit; only one malaria *episode* is possible in a 30-day period. Therefore, each bout is either considered the start of a new episode, or, if it occurs within 30 days of a previous bout, part of the same episode. Thus, at least in low transmission settings, an episode should roughly correspond to one malaria infection (which can cause multiple bouts). An episode's severity (non-malarial, malarial or severe) is considered to be that of its worst bout.</dd>
  <dt>Event</dt> 
  <dd>In the clinical models, an occurrence without measurable duration.</dd>
  <dt>Experiment</dt>
  <dd>Largely synonymous with a study, an *experiment* is the complete description of all sweeps and arms used, together with the scenarios generated and results produced. Each scenario is generated by choosing one arm for each sweep in the experiment.</dd>
  <dt>Fully factorial design</dt>
  <dd>A *fully factorial* experiment is one where all possible scenarios are generated: all combinations of one arm per sweep are used.</dd>
  <dt>Health system memory</dt>
  <dd>The pre-determined, fixed period of time, currently set at 30 days, during which all bouts of illness are considered to be related to the same infection. The *health system memory* has implications for reporting and for treatment practices.</dd>
  <dt>Implementation</dt>
  <dd>Each _component_ needs at least one *implementation*, describing how the relevent processes are simulated. Logically, these can also be called _models_.</dd>
  <dt>Intervention</dt>
  <dd>During the a simulation of a _scenario_, some type of *intervention* may be used, usually with the aim of reducing malaria transmission, prevalence, clinical manifestations or costs. These _interventions_ may be deployed at a point in time (*timed* mode) or whenever humans reach a certain age (*continuous* mode).</dd>
  <dd>The methods for simulating the deployment of interventions in _OpenMalaria_ have also been used to simulate the effects of other phenomena which are not interventions, therefore termed *pseudo interventions* (see [ModelInterventions#Pseudo_interventions examples]).</dd>
  <dt>Model</dt>
  <dd>The openmalaria simulator platform supports several *models*: each is a selection of options (including a choice of _implementations_) defining how _scenarios_ are simulated.</dd>
  <dd>In the past, both _components_ and _implementations_ have been referred to as *models*.</dd>
  <dt>Non-malarial fever</dt>
  <dd>A febrile illness, accompanied or not by parasites in the blood, which is not caused by malaria parasites.</dd>
  <dt>OpenMalaria</dt>
  <dd>*OpenMalaria* is the name of the C++ project and is the implementation of our simulator; i.e. the source code on this website.</dd>
  <dt>Parameterization</dt>
  <dd>Each _model_ has several parameters. A choice of values for each of these parameters leads to a *parameterization* of a _model_. We usually use a fitting process involving several _scenarios_ modelling field trials in order to find optimal parameterizations.</dd>
  <dt>Scenario</dt>
  <dd>_OpenMalaria_ takes as its input a *scenario* file describing what it should simulate. This includes a description of the _model_ and _parameterization_ to use, as well as the setting, _interventions_ to use, and other parameters relevent to the _study_.</dd>
  <dt>Seed</dt>
  <dd>Each time a scenario is simulated, the (psuedo-)random number generator must be started from some *seed* (generally a positive integer); using a different seed will affect the generation of each pseudo-random number and correspondingly may alter the outcome of stochastic decisions. Additionally, in saying that an experiment was run with 5 *seeds*, we mean that each scenario was run 5 times, each time with a different seed.</dd>
  <dt>Severe malaria</dt>
  <dd>Clinical malaria illness that is life-threatening if left untreated.</dd>
  <dt>Study</dt>
  <dd>A simulation *study* comprises a set of scenarios used to make a specific set of comparisons between settings or interventions.  The word *study* is also used to refer to field studies used for parameterizing models.</dd>
  <dt>Sweep</dt>
  <dd>A *sweep* is one or more covarying factors, and the set of all arms of this sweep.</dd>
