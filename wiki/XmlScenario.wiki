#summary Editing scenario descriptions

= Introduction =

The main input to the simulator is an [http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp XML] file traditionally called `scenario.xml` (though it may be named something different if the `--scenario FILE` command-line option is passed to openmalaria). This has many sections, described here. Additionally the file contents are described in a more technical (and probably more complete) way by the [http://www.w3schools.com/schema/default.asp XSD] schema [http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/source/browse/trunk/model/scenario.xsd file].
