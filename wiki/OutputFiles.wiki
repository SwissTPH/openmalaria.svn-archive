#summary Overview of statistics outputs

= Output Files =

There are currently two statistical output files:

  * output.txt — three-dimensional (survey, measure and often age-group) general statistics
  * vector.txt — two-dimensional (time-step and measure) statistics from the vector transmission model

Both consist of lines of tab-separated values.

In addition a third file, scenario.sum is produced.
This is only used only for internal validation.

== output.txt ==

Each line in this file specifies one record, and consists of four columns:

  # Survey number (starting from one; indicates which survey specified in the [XmlScenario scenario file] this record is from)
  # 3rd dimension (often corresponding to age group, but may mean something else or be 0)
  # Measure as an integer code (see below)
  # Value

The value of the measure field affects how the other fields are interpreted. All but the `imr_summary` (code: 21) measure come from a survey. Most of the existing measures are reported per age-group and the 3rd dimension of the record specifies which age group specified in the scenario file the statistic comes from, while some of the newer measures use the 3rd-dimension to indicate the mosquito species/variant (as a string), and a few measures don't use this field. The value is always an integer or floating-point number, but its units depend on the measure.

=== measures ===

The measure indicates the meaning of statistics. It is specified by a short string identifier in the [XmlScenario scenario file] and by an integer code in the output files (a space optimization for when the results get imported into the results database).

== ctsout.txt ==

Some data can also be output to this file, in a simpler format (often a single value per time-step). Data output capabilities have some overlap with `output.txt`, but have the advantages of simpler [XmlScenario#Continuous_reporting configuration] and a simple output format which can be easily plotted using LiveGraph or a spreadsheet program.
