automatic schema translator

= Automatic schema version update =

If you use some scenarii working with an older schema version, you can update those with the schema translator. The translation may not work for some scenarii (The program will output the parameters you have to change or/and add manually and exit). 


== Build and Install ==
  
  * Building the schema translator from sources:
      # Check if JDK and at least version 5 is installed. 
          * If it's not the case, then you can download the installer [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp, here]. 
          * On ubuntu linux you can install de JDK with apt-get. Execute the command {{{sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk}}}. 
      # Find the sources. 
          * If you are already working with the openmalaria sources, then you can find the schema translator source files in util
      # Build the sources.
          * in the sources folder do {{{javac SchemaTranslator.java}}}

== Usage ==

You need to put the scenarios to be converted in the scenarios folder and then start the program from terminal/command line with the command {{{java SchemaTranslator}}} or if you want to start the SchemaTranslator from another location then you have to use {{{java -classpath path_to_schematranslator_folder SchemaTranslator}}}. If everything is working fine, then you should find the updated scenarios in the folder translatedScenarios.

If you don't add any options, then the scenarios will be converted to the latest schema version.

== Options ==
   * --required_version XX: The version number to update the scenarios to. By default, the latest schema version will be used.
   * --no-validation: The scenarios are converted and written without any validation against the schema
   * --no-translation: The scenarios are not written, but still converted for validation
   * --maxDensCorrection BOOL: Update 12->13 requires this sometimes: set true to include bug fix, false to explicitly exclude it.
   * --iptiSpOptionWithoutInterventions: For scenarios with iptiDescription but without interventions, assume usage of the IPTI model was (t) intended or (f) a mistake.
