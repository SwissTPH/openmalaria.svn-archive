#summary Intervention deployment methods and descriptions

= Interventions =

An intervention is a method used to bring about a _change_ in the state of the simulation (eg to reduce transmission). Some of these are realistic strategies (e.g. vaccine treatment), some of these unrealistic (e.g. "uninfect vectors"), and some don't concern themselves with transmission (e.g. cohort selection). Note that existing malaria-control measures such as the initial state of the health-system are not considered interventions. They are a description of the initial state that will be altered by the proposed intervention.


== Descriptions ==

Documentation of interventions can be found on these pages:

  * [ModelIntervHuman human-stage interventions]
  * [ModelIntervVector mosquito-stage interventions]
  * [ModelIntervMisc special/pseudo interventions]


== Deployment ==

There are two generic methods of intervention deployment in openmalaria:

 * *Timed* mass-deployment campaigns. At a particular time point, this deployment method targets either the whole population or a subset of the population restricted by age. Timed deployment campaigns are described by a coverage parameter. ([http://code.google.com/p/openmalaria/wiki/XmlScenario?ts=1277108255&updated=XmlScenario#Timed:_timed Configuration])
 * Age-based *continuous* deployment. Within the simulation's intervention period, interventions are deployed as individuals reach a target age, given that the individuals are within the coverage. ([XmlScenario#Continuous:_continuous Configuration])

In both deployment situations, the coverage parameter describes the probability of each individual with the required age receiving the intervention, independently of interventions received previously by that individual.

Deployment of vaccines to a population is a special case. Each human "remembers" how many vaccine doses they have received (through continuous and campaign deployment combined). Given a continuous vaccination schedule for vaccinating at ages `a_0`, `a_1`, ..., each individual, at age `a_n` is vaccinated (through the continuous vaccination program) if and only if they are included within the vaccine coverage, and they have had `n - 1` previous vaccinations. Thus, account is taken of individuals that may dropout of the continuous vaccination program never to return, and those vaccinated through a mass campaign who would likely skip an age-based vaccination at (roughly) the same time.


== Configuration ==

Interventions are configured within the `interventions` element in the [ScenarioDesign scenario XML document]. A sample element:

{{{
  <interventions name="cohort selection">
    <MDA>
      <description>
        <decisions>
          <decision depends="" name="treatment" values="1">1</decision>
          <decision depends="" name="test" values="none,microscopy,RDT">none</decision>
        </decisions>
        <treatments>
          <treatment name="1">
            <schedule>
              <medicate drug="MQ" hour="0" mg="1200"/>
            </schedule>
          </treatment>
        </treatments>
      </description>
      <timed coverage="0.6" time="730"/>
    </MDA>
    <cohort>
      <continuous coverage="0.05" targetAgeYrs="1.0"/>
      <timed coverage="0.4" time="0"/>
    </cohort>
  </interventions>
}}}

Here two interventions are used: `MDA` and `cohort` [selection]. Intervention elements (`changeHS`, `MDA`, `ITN` and so on) may be listed in any order, either occurring once or being omitted. Within the element description sub-elements come first, then continuous deployment descriptions, and finally timed deployment descriptions; the orders of sub-elements are fixed (although many sub-elements are optional and some can be listed multiple times).

=== Continuous descriptions ===

All continuous deployments are described by elements of type `ageSpecific`; for example, a vaccine schedule starting with doses at 1, 2, 3 and 15 months of age:

{{{
    <vaccine>
      <description vaccineType="TBV">
        <decay L="0.5" function="exponential"/>
        <efficacyB value="10"/>
        <initialEfficacy value="0.4"/>
        <initialEfficacy value="0.46"/>
        <initialEfficacy value="0.52"/>
      </description>
      <continuous coverage="0.95" targetAgeYrs="0.0833"/>
      <continuous coverage="0.95" targetAgeYrs="0.17"/>
      <continuous coverage="0.99" targetAgeYrs="0.25"/>
      <continuous coverage="0.99" targetAgeYrs="1.25"/>
      <continuous coverage="0.99" targetAgeYrs="2.25"/>
      <continuous coverage="0.99" targetAgeYrs="3.25"/>
      <continuous coverage="0.99" targetAgeYrs="4.25"/>
    </vaccine>
}}}

Attributes that can be included:

|| name || type || description ||
|| `coverage` || floating-point || Proportion of eligible candidates actually receiving the intervention (range [0-1]) ||
|| `targetAgeYrs` || floating-point || Age at which individuals are eligible for this intervention in years ||
|| `cohort` || boolean || Restrict distribution to the current [Monitoring#Cohort-mode cohort] if true ||
|| `begin` || integer || The time-step of the intervention period at which this intervention becomes active (default: 0) ||
|| `end` || integer || The time-step of the intervention period at which this intervention becomes inactive (default: 2147483647) ||

Note that before schema 30, the youngest age at which continuous interventions can be deployed was 1 time-step old (1 over time-steps-per-year), though they are still efficacious on the first update. Since schema 30 interventions can be deployed from age 0, but have their first effect on the following time-step (since it is inappropriate to let interventions have an instant effect).


=== Timed descriptions ===

Many timed interventions also use a standard type of description for *mass deployment*, although several timed interventions use a different description. From the `MDA` element of the above example, we have deployment to 60% of the population at time step 730:

{{{
      <timed coverage="0.6" time="730"/>
}}}

Attributes:

|| name || type || description ||
|| time || integer || Time of deployment ||
|| coverage || floating-point || Proportion of eligible candidates actually receiving the intervention (range [0-1]) ||
|| minAge || floating-point || Minimum age (inclusive) at which humans are considered eligible in years (defaults to 0) ||
|| maxAge || floating-point || Maximum age (exclusive) at which humans are considered eligible in years (defaults to 100) ||
|| cohort || boolean || Restrict distribution to the current [Monitoring#Cohort-mode cohort] if true (defaults to false) ||
|| cumulativeWithMaxAge || int (optional) || If given, activates an optional deployment mode (see below). ||

To clarify age based constraints, they are met if minAge â‰¤ age < maxAge.

==== Cumulative coverage deployment ====

Without the `cumulativeWithMaxAge` option, the intervention deployment simply targets the proportion of eligible humans described by the coverage parameter. With the option, the number of protected humans are first counted and unprotected humans targeted such that the total number of eligible humans reaches the proportion described by coverage.

Humans are considered protected by an intervention if the last time step they received the intervention is less than the "max intervention age" (cumulativeWithMaxAge attribute).    Those considered protected retain their original intervention (bed net/vaccination/...).

When the existing proportion of humans protected, _p_, is less than the desired coverage level _c_, unprotected humans have chance [http://openmalaria.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/eqns/cum_deploy_cov.png] of receiving a new instance of the intervention (net/vaccine dose/house spraying etc.). This rule applies across all humans eligible for coverage (those within the given age range and within the cohort if applicable).

Cumulative coverage deployment was added in r1595 (released as version 25), and is available for the vaccine, IPTi, ITN, IRS and VA interventions, and for interventions applied to specific cohorts, where grouping is identified by cohort membership, not age.
