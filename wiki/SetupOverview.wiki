#summary Overview of building and installation methods

= Participate in the volunteer computing effort! =

If you would like to help the project by offering down-time on your computer to run simulations, join us at [http://www.malariacontrol.net malariacontrol.net]

= Running your own simulations =

If you would like to run your own simulations you have the following options:

  * run your own simulation scenarios directly from the command line as described on the [UtilsRunning] page.  This is a good way to learn about the capabilities of *openmalaria* and to test small numbers of scenarios.  

  * install the compiled tool with GUI [openmalariaTools openmalariaTools].  This includes facilities for updating configuration files and running small simulation experiments comprising multiple scenarios.  

The [Binaries] page gives general information on how and where to install pre-built executables of *openmalaria*.

= Contributing to *openmalaria* development =

  * If you want to join the development effort, you can find the source code [Code#Source_code here].
  * To build the openmalaria executable from source, go [BuildSystem here]

= Tools =

The configuration files for *openmalaria* are in XML format, which allows them to be edited by a text editor.  We recommend the following:

  * [UtilsWindows Windows] — a convenient text editor, and archive tool
  * For MacOSX — handles archives fine but not necessarily XML files; dashcode (presumably part of [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ xcode]) can edit XML files but struggles with scripts. There are a number of other MacOSX editors [http://www.google.com/search?q=macosx+text+editor search for one]
