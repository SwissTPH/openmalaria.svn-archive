#summary Overview of building and installation methods

= Participation in the volunteer computing effort =

If you want to help the project by offering down-time on your computer to run simulations, join our project at [http://www.malariacontrol.net malariacontrol.net]

= Installing =

See also the [Binaries] page for information on how and where to install pre-built executables of *openmalaria*.

If you want to run your own simulations, you have the following options:
  * install the compiled tool with GUI [openmalariaTools OpenMalariaTools]  
  * build the openmalaria executable from [BuildSystem source]

= Running =

[openmalariaTools openmalariaTools] includes facilities for updating and running scenarios. Alternatively, they can be run directly from the command line as described on the [UtilsRunning] page.

= Tools =

It can also be helpful to have a good text editor on hand, especially one that can edit XML files easily. 

  * [UtilsWindows Windows] — a convenient text editor, and archive tool
